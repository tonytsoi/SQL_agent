# AI SQL Agent
Incorporating structured data into a LLM requires a different approach from that of unstructured text data. RAG is usually implemented for unstructured data which generates text that can be searched against a vector database. For structured data, it is more often to have the LLM to write and execute queries to directly extract data from the database. AI agent with reasoning capabilities can make the decisions during the query generation and execution process. 

The LLM SQL agent can understand the relationships within the data tables, generate and execute the correct SQL query, and incorporate the extracted information in its response.
